			<h2 id="home">AGRICULTURE</h2>
			<p>Agriculture encompasses crop and livestock production, aquaculture, fisheries, and forestry for food and non-food products.[1] Agriculture was the key development in the rise of sedentary human civilization, whereby farming of domesticated species created food surpluses that enabled people to live in cities. While humans started gathering grains at least 105,000 years ago, nascent farmers only began planting them around 11,500 years ago. Sheep, goats, pigs, and cattle were domesticated around 10,000 years ago. Plants were independently cultivated in at least 11 regions of the world. In the 20th century, industrial agriculture based on large-scale monocultures came to dominate agricultural output.</p>
			<p>As of 2021, small farms produce about one-third of the world's food, but large farms are prevalent.[2] The largest 1% of farms in the world are greater than 50 hectares (120 acres) and operate more than 70% of the world's farmland.[2] Nearly 40% of agricultural land is found on farms larger than 1,000 hectares (2,500 acres).[2] However, five of every six farms in the world consist of less than 2 hectares (4.9 acres) and take up only around 12% of all agricultural land.[2] Farms and farming greatly influence rural economics and greatly shape rural society, effecting both the direct agricultural workforce and broader businesses that support the farms and farming populations.</p>
			<p>The major agricultural products can be broadly grouped into foods, fibers, fuels, and raw materials (such as rubber). Food classes include cereals (grains), vegetables, fruits, cooking oils, meat, milk, eggs, and fungi. Global agricultural production amounts to approximately 11 billion tonnes of food,[3] 32 million tonnes of natural fibres[4] and 4 billion m3 of wood.[5] However, around 14% of the world's food is lost from production before reaching the retail level.[6]</p>
			<p>Modern agronomy, plant breeding, agrochemicals such as pesticides and fertilizers, and technological developments have sharply increased crop yields, but also contributed to ecological and environmental damage. Selective breeding and modern practices in animal husbandry have similarly increased the output of meat, but have raised concerns about animal welfare and environmental damage. Environmental issues include contributions to climate change, depletion of aquifers, deforestation, antibiotic resistance, and other agricultural pollution. Agriculture is both a cause of and sensitive to environmental degradation, such as biodiversity loss, desertification, soil degradation, and climate change, all of which can cause decreases in crop yield. Genetically modified organisms are widely used, although some countries ban them.</p>

			<h2 id="Origins">ORIGINS</h2>
			<p>The development of agriculture enabled the human population to grow many times larger than could be sustained by hunting and gathering.[16] Agriculture began independently in different parts of the globe,[17] and included a diverse range of taxa, in at least 11 separate centers of origin.[14] Wild grains were collected and eaten from at least 105,000 years ago.[18] In the Paleolithic Levant, 23,000 years ago, cereals cultivation of emmer, barley, and oats has been observed near the sea of Galilee.[19][20] Rice was domesticated in China between 11,500 and 6,200 BC with the earliest known cultivation from 5,700 BC,[21] followed by mung, soy and azuki beans. Sheep were domesticated in Mesopotamia between 13,000 and 11,000 years ago.</p>
			<p> Cattle were domesticated from the wild aurochs in the areas of modern Turkey and Pakistan some 10,500 years ago.[23] Pig production emerged in Eurasia, including Europe, East Asia and Southwest Asia,[24] where wild boar were first domesticated about 10,500 years ago.</p>
			<p> Studies of the transition from hunter-gatherer to agricultural societies indicate an initial period of intensification and increasing sedentism; examples are the Natufian culture in the Levant, and the Early Chinese Neolithic in China. Then, wild stands that had previously been harvested started to be planted, and gradually came to be domesticated.</p>
			<h2 id="Revolution">REVOLUTION</h2>
			<p>In the Middle Ages, compared to the Roman period, agriculture in Western Europe became more focused on self-sufficiency. The agricultural population under feudalism was typically organized into manors consisting of several hundred or more acres of land presided over by a lord of the manor with a Roman Catholic church and priest</p>
			<p>After 1492, the Columbian exchange brought New World crops such as maize, potatoes, tomatoes, sweet potatoes, and manioc to Europe, and Old World crops such as wheat, barley, rice, and turnips, and livestock (including horses, cattle, sheep and goats) to the Americas.</p>
			<p>Modern agriculture has raised or encountered ecological, political, and economic issues including water pollution, biofuels, genetically modified organisms, tariffs and farm subsidies, leading to alternative approaches such as the organic movement.[87][88] Unsustainable farming practices in North America led to the Dust Bowl of the 1930s.</p>
			<h2 id="Status">STATUS</h2>
			<p>From the twentieth century onwards, intensive agriculture increased crop productivity. It substituted synthetic fertilizers and pesticides for labour, but caused increased water pollution, and often involved farm subsidies. Soil degradation and diseases such as stem rust are major concerns globally;[96] approximately 40% of the world's agricultural land is seriously degraded.[97][98] In recent years there has been a backlash against the environmental effects of conventional agriculture, resulting in the organic, regenerative, and sustainable agriculture movements.</p>
			<p>By 2015, the agricultural output of China was the largest in the world, followed by the European Union, India and the United States.[106] Economists measure the total factor productivity of agriculture, according to which agriculture in the United States is roughly 1.7 times more productive than it was in 1948.</p>
			<p>Despite increases in agricultural production and productivity,[109] between 702 and 828 million people were affected by hunger in 2021.[110] Food insecurity and malnutrition can be the result of conflict, climate extremes and variability and economic swings</p>

			<h3>Agriculture:</h3>
			<img src="agriculture.jpg" alt="Voltas 1 Ton 3 Star, Inverter Split AC" width=500pxl>
			<p>Agriculture is one of the most important sectors of the economy, and the efficient use of opportunities provided by technological advancements has always been the foundation for sustainable growth and development of this industry.</p>
			<p>The Internet of Things technology is both changing such areas as manufacturing, healthcare, insurance, and some others often discussed sectors and promises fundamental changes in agriculture. Product quality, higher crop yields, resource conservation, and cost control are but a few ways that the Internet of Things promises to transform in the agriculture industry and food production in the nearest future.</p>
			<img src="i1.jpg" alt="Voltas 1 Ton 3 Star, Inverter Split AC" width=300pxl>
			<p>1. Pest control</p>
			<p>Weed and pest control has always been an essential component of crop growing. The modern market already features systems helping farmers to stick to the required pesticide application rates and make the process as efficient as possible. For instance, special traps allow crop producers to control the situation with pests in the fields, showing them the real number of insects in the area, automatically calculating specimens in the trap.</p>
			<img src="i2.jpg" alt="Voltas 1 Ton 3 Star, Inverter Split AC" width=300pxl>
			<p>2. Automatic irrigation</p>
			<p>Currently, widely used drip irrigation systems allow farmers to control the amount of water that crops receive and the time of water supply to the field. By adding IoT sensors to existing irrigation systems to monitor soil moisture levels and plants condition, farmers can make such systems almost completely autonomous. They will have to intervene in the process exclusively in case of some issues.</p>
			<img src="i3.jpg" alt="Voltas 1 Ton 3 Star, Inverter Split AC" width=300pxl>
			<p>3. Crop harvesting, storage, and processing</p>
			<p>Geological mapping technologies combined with sensor data on soil quality, density, moisture levels and, fertility help agribusinesses minimize the chance factor when sowing seeds. This approach increases germination rates, plant growth, and resulting yields. 	</p>
			<img src="i4.jpg" alt="Voltas 1 Ton 3 Star, Inverter Split AC" width=300pxl>
			<p>4. Livestock monitoring</p>
			<p>Special collars and other sensors allow cattle farm owners to monitor both the whole herd and individual animals. Using IoT sensors, farmers can implement the following things:<br>

1.monitoring collective data on the herd;<br>
2.warning about animal walking beyond the geofence;<br>
3.tracking animal health;<br>
4.monitoring milk production, etc.<br>
For instance, based on the analysis of the data obtained, pregnant or sick animals can be identified to timely separate them from the herd and prevent the spread of the disease.</p>
